This is for internal use only, and does not constitute a verbatim record of the meeting.\n\nGood first prep call ahead of the December UNEA meeting.\n\nBroad consensus that the best outcome at UNEA-7 is no climate intervention/SRM resolution..\n\nIf no resolution is not possible, broad agreement to focus on language defending science and the dangers of near-term climate risks.\n\nAgreement that Climate Hub would schedule follow-up call with scenario-based agenda and develop scenario discussion frameworks.\n\nAgreement to consider organizing Green Room session, and to investigate the Science & Tech Major Group task force.\n\nUNEA-7 calendar and green room time slots to be shared.\n\nSUMMARY: UNEA-7 PREPARATORY COORDINATION CALL\n\nDate: October 3, 2025\n Distribution: Meeting Participants + Relevant Organizations\n Classification: Internal Coordination - Not for Public Distribution\n\nPURPOSE & PARTICIPANTS\n\nClimate Hub convened representatives from 11+ organizations to coordinate strategy for UNEA-7 (December 2025) on solar radiation management (SRM) research.\n\nParticipating Organizations: Climate Hub, Degrees Initiative, Reflective, Carbon Gap (CFG), DSG, Center for Climate and Security, EDF, RFF, Silver Lining/UCLA Law, University of Chicago, p",

Capacity Imbalances\n\nOpposition strategically positioned in MGS processes (Science & Tech Major Group task force likely)\n\nGovernment understanding gaps on state of science, governance implications, geopolitical complexity\n\nEducation needed but must not provoke resolution introduction\n\n3. Coordination Challenges\n\nMust avoid \"Global North agenda\" perception\n\nRequires joint Global South hosting/participation\n\nVarious organizational mandates and constraints\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions (Assigned)\n\nFarhan (Climate Hub):\n\nSchedule next call with scenario-based agenda\n\nCoordinate summary distribution with Geraldine\n\nDevelop scenario discussion frameworks\n\nAnita (Degrees):\n\nShare UNEA-7 calendar and green room time slots\n\nMonitor Scien",
