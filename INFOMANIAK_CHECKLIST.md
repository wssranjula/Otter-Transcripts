## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Service Won't Start

- [ ] Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u gdrive-monitor -n 50`
- [ ] Test manually: `cd ~/Otter-Transcripts && source venv/bin/activate && python run_gdrive.py batch`
- [ ] Check config: `cat config/gdrive_config.json`
- [ ] Verify credentials exist: `ls -la config/credentials.json`

### Authentication Issues

- [ ] Delete token: `rm config/token.pickle`
- [ ] Re-authenticate: `python run_gdrive.py setup`
- [ ] Check credentials file is valid JSON

### No Files Being Processed

- [ ] Verify Google Drive folder ID in config
- [ ] Check state file: `cat config/gdrive_state.json`
- [ ] Upload test file to Google Drive
- [ ] Watch logs: `tail -f ~/gdrive-monitor.log`

### Out of Memory

- [ ] Check memory: `free -h`
- [ ] Add swap space (see DEPLOYMENT_INFOMANIAK.md)
- [ ] Consider upgrading VPS plan
