# Sub-Agent Architecture for Context Isolation

## Overview

Sybil now supports a **sub-agent architecture** that provides context isolation through specialized agents. This is a superior alternative to virtual filesystem and message truncation approaches.

## The Problem Sub-Agents Solve

### Without Sub-Agents (Traditional Approach)

```
Main Agent Context (accumulates everything):
├─ System Prompt: 8,000 tokens
├─ User Question: 50 tokens
├─ Query 1 Results: 50,000 tokens ⚠️
├─ Query 2 Results: 50,000 tokens ⚠️
├─ Analysis: 2,000 tokens
└─ Synthesis: 500 tokens
─────────────────────────────────
Total: 110,550 tokens ❌ OVERFLOW!
```

**Problems**:
- Context accumulation leads to overflow
- Mixed objectives cause confusion
- Duplicate tool call ID errors
- All data kept in single context

### With Sub-Agents (New Approach)

```
Supervisor Agent (clean context):
├─ Task 1: "Query July meetings" → Query Sub-Agent
│  ├─ Sub-Agent Context (isolated):
│  │  ├─ Task: 100 tokens
│  │  ├─ Query: 300 tokens
│  │  └─ Results: 50,000 tokens
│  └─ Returns Summary: 500 tokens ✅
│
├─ Task 2: "Query October meetings" → Query Sub-Agent
│  ├─ Sub-Agent Context (isolated):
│  │  ├─ Task: 100 tokens
│  │  ├─ Query: 300 tokens
│  │  └─ Results: 50,000 tokens
│  └─ Returns Summary: 500 tokens ✅
│
├─ Task 3: "Compare both" → Analysis Sub-Agent
│  ├─ Sub-Agent Context (isolated):
│  │  ├─ Task + Data: 1,500 tokens
│  │  └─ Analysis: 1,000 tokens
│  └─ Returns Findings: 1,000 tokens ✅
│
└─ Synthesize: 2,500 tokens

Supervisor Context Total: 4,500 tokens ✅ NO OVERFLOW!
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No context overflow
- ✅ No duplicate tool call IDs
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Parallel execution possible
- ✅ Specialized expertise

## Architecture Design

### Two Specialized Sub-Agents + Supervisor

#### 1. Query Agent (Database Specialist)

**Role**: Execute Neo4j queries and return concise summaries

**Tools**:
- `get_database_schema`
- `execute_cypher_query`
- `search_content_types`

**Input**: Query request from supervisor
**Output**: Concise summary (max 500 words) with key findings

**Capabilities**:
- Standard content queries (meetings, chunks, entities)
- **Entity relationship queries** (NEW): Find relationships between entities
- Multi-hop network queries: Traverse entity connections
- Organizational structure queries: Find who works for which organizations

**Example - Standard Query**:
```
Supervisor: "Query all July meetings about US strategy"
Query Agent: 
  1. Executes Cypher query
  2. Gets 10 meetings with full content (50,000 tokens)
  3. Summarizes to 500 tokens:
     "Found 10 meetings. Main topics: federal engagement,
      state-level partnerships, IRA implementation..."
```

**Example - Relationship Query**:
```
Supervisor: "Who works for Organization X?"
Query Agent:
  1. Executes relationship query:
     MATCH (p:Entity:Person)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(o:Entity:Organization {name: 'X'})
     RETURN p.name, r.context
  2. Returns concise summary:
     "Found 5 people: Tom Pravda (strategy lead), 
      Sue Biniaz (policy director), ..."
```

**Example - Network Query**:
```
Supervisor: "How are Person A and Person B connected?"
Query Agent:
  1. Executes multi-hop query:
     MATCH path = (e1:Entity {name: 'A'})-[*1..2]-(e2:Entity {name: 'B'})
     RETURN path
  2. Returns connection summary:
     "Connected via: A WORKS_FOR Organization X, 
      B also WORKS_FOR Organization X (colleagues)"
```

#### 2. Analysis Agent (Data Analyst)

**Role**: Analyze data, extract themes, identify patterns

**Tools**: None (pure reasoning)

**Input**: Data to analyze from supervisor
**Output**: Structured analysis (max 500 words) with themes/insights

**Example**:
```
Supervisor: "Analyze these July and October summaries"
Analysis Agent:
  1. Compares both datasets
  2. Identifies themes and changes
  3. Returns structured analysis:
     "Main themes: X, Y, Z
      Key changes: A→B, C→D
      Trends: Increasing focus on..."
```

---

### Main Sybil Agent (Supervisor)

**Role**: Coordinate sub-agents and synthesize final answer

**Tools**:
- `task(description, subagent_type)` - Delegate to sub-agents
- `write_todos(todos)` - Create/update TODO plan
- `read_todos()` - Check progress
- `mark_todo_completed(id, summary)` - Update status

**Why TODO tools are on supervisor**:
- TODO management is a **coordination function** (not execution)
- Supervisor needs direct access to workflow state for decisions
- Avoids unnecessary delegation overhead
- More efficient (no need to delegate for simple TODO updates)

**Decision Logic**:

```python
if simple_query:
    # Answer directly (e.g., "Who are you?")
    return direct_answer

elif needs_single_query:
    # Delegate to query-agent
    summary = task("Query X", "query-agent")
    return format_answer(summary)

elif needs_query_and_analysis:
    # Delegate to both agents
    data = task("Query X", "query-agent")
    insights = task("Analyze this data", "analysis-agent")
    return synthesize(data, insights)

elif needs_comparison:
    # Multiple queries + analysis
    data1 = task("Query July", "query-agent")
    data2 = task("Query October", "query-agent")
    comparison = task("Compare these", "analysis-agent")
    return synthesize(data1, data2, comparison)

elif very_complex:
    # Create TODO plan directly
    write_todos([...plan...])
    # Execute plan with sub-agents
    for todo in plan:
        write_todos([...mark in_progress...])
        result = task("Execute TODO", "appropriate-agent")
        write_todos([...mark completed...])
    return comprehensive_answer
```

---

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Simple Query (No Sub-Agents)

**Query**: "Who are you?"

**Workflow**:
```
Supervisor:
  - Recognizes simple question
  - Answers directly from system prompt
  - No sub-agents needed

Context Usage: 500 tokens
```

---

### Example 2: Single Database Query

**Query**: "What was discussed in the last meeting?"

**Workflow**:
```
Supervisor:
  Step 1: task("Find and summarize the last meeting", "query-agent")
  
Query Agent (isolated context):
  - Executes Cypher query
  - Gets meeting content (20,000 tokens)
  - Returns summary (400 tokens):
    "All Hands Meeting - Oct 8
     Topics: UNEA prep, Germany strategy, UK engagement
     Key decisions: Prioritize US federal, deprioritize Germany
     Action items: Sarah follow up on UK, Tom coordinate UNEA"

Supervisor:
  Step 2: Synthesize with citations
    "Based on the All Hands Call on October 8..."

Context Usage:
  - Supervisor: 1,000 tokens
  - Query Agent (isolated): 20,500 tokens
  - Total supervisor context: 1,000 tokens ✅
```

---

### Example 3: Complex Query with Analysis

**Query**: "What was discussed in all hands meetings?"

**Workflow**:
```
Supervisor:
  Step 1: task("Query all 'All Hands' meetings and summarize", "query-agent")
  
  Query Agent (isolated context):
    - Queries 13 meetings (60,000 tokens of data)
    - Summarizes each meeting
    - Returns (500 tokens):
      "Found 13 All Hands meetings (May-Oct):
       Recurring themes: UNEA prep, international engagement,
       funding discussions
       Key decisions: Germany deprioritized, US focus increased
       Main participants: Tom, Sarah, Sue, [others]"
  
  Step 2: task("Extract main themes from this summary", "analysis-agent")
  
  Analysis Agent (isolated context):
    - Analyzes the 500-token summary
    - Extracts themes
    - Returns (400 tokens):
      "Main Themes:
       1. Strategic pivots (Germany→US)
       2. UNEA preparation efforts
       3. Stakeholder coordination
       Key insights: [...]"
  
  Step 3: Synthesize final answer
    "Based on 13 All Hands meetings from May to October...
     
     **Strategic Priorities**:
     - [Using data from analysis]
     
     Sources: All Hands meetings May-Oct 2025"

Context Usage:
  - Supervisor: 2,500 tokens
  - Query Agent (isolated): 60,500 tokens
  - Analysis Agent (isolated): 1,000 tokens
  - Total supervisor context: 2,500 tokens ✅
```

---

### Example 4: Comparison Query

**Query**: "How has our US strategy evolved from July to October?"

**Workflow**:
```
Supervisor:
  Step 1: write_todos([
    {id:"1", content:"Query July meetings", status:"pending"},
    {id:"2", content:"Query October meetings", status:"pending"},
    {id:"3", content:"Analyze evolution", status:"pending"},
    {id:"4", content:"Synthesize answer", status:"pending"}
  ])

  Step 2: write_todos([...mark TODO 1 in_progress...])
  Step 3: task("Query July meetings about US strategy", "query-agent")
          → Returns 400-token summary
  Step 4: write_todos([...mark TODO 1 completed...])

  Step 5: write_todos([...mark TODO 2 in_progress...])
  Step 6: task("Query October meetings about US strategy", "query-agent")
          → Returns 400-token summary
  Step 7: write_todos([...mark TODO 2 completed...])

  Step 8: write_todos([...mark TODO 3 in_progress...])
  Step 9: task("Compare July and October summaries", "analysis-agent")
          → Returns 500-token comparison:
            "Evolution from July to October:
             July: State-level focus, exploratory
             October: Federal-level focus, structured engagement
             Key shifts: [...]"
  Step 10: write_todos([...mark TODO 3 completed...])

  Step 11: Synthesize with citations
    "Our US strategy has evolved significantly...
     
     **July Approach**: [from analysis]
     **October Approach**: [from analysis]
     **Key Changes**: [from analysis]"
  
  Step 12: write_todos([...mark TODO 4 completed...])

Context Usage:
  - Supervisor: 3,000 tokens (includes TODO management)
  - Query Agents (isolated): 50,000 tokens each
  - Analysis Agent (isolated): 1,500 tokens
  - Total supervisor context: 3,000 tokens ✅
  
Efficiency: TODO management adds ~200 tokens vs delegating to TODO Manager (~2 seconds per call)
```

## Benefits Summary

### 1. Context Isolation

**Problem Solved**: Context overflow

**How**: Each sub-agent operates in its own context window containing only its specific task. The supervisor only receives concise summaries.

**Impact**: 95%+ reduction in supervisor context usage

### 2. No Duplicate Tool Call IDs

**Problem Solved**: "Duplicate tool call id in assistant message" errors

**How**: Each sub-agent is a separate agent instance with its own tool execution. No shared tool call ID space.

**Impact**: Errors eliminated completely

### 3. Specialized Expertise

**Problem Solved**: Mixed objectives causing confusion

**How**: Each sub-agent has specific tools and focused prompts for its specialty.

**Impact**: Better quality results, clearer organization

### 4. Parallel Execution (Future)

**Problem Solved**: Sequential queries are slow

**How**: Supervisor can delegate to multiple sub-agents simultaneously.

**Impact**: 3-5x faster for multi-query tasks

## Usage

### Run Sybil with Sub-Agents

```bash
python run_sybil_subagents.py
```

### Example Session

```
You: What was discussed in all hands meetings?

Sybil:
[Verbose mode shows:]
  → Delegating to query-agent: "Query all All Hands meetings..."
  ← Query agent returns: "Found 13 meetings..."
  → Delegating to analysis-agent: "Extract main themes..."
  ← Analysis agent returns: "Main themes: 1. X, 2. Y..."
  → Synthesizing final answer...

Based on 13 All Hands meetings from May to October 2025:

**Strategic Priorities**:
- International engagement focus (UNEA 7, bilateral partnerships)
- Resource allocation decisions (Germany deprioritized, US increased)
- Stakeholder coordination across federal and state levels

**Key Decisions**:
- Germany work put on hold (Oct 8 meeting)
- US federal engagement prioritized
- UK partnership exploration underway

**Notable Participants**: Tom Pravda (strategy lead), Sarah (UK coordination), Sue Biniaz (US engagement)

Sources: All Hands meetings May 28, Jun 11, Jul 16, Jul 23, Jul 30, Aug 6, Sep 3, Sep 10, Sep 17, Oct 1, Oct 8 (2025)
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Parallel Execution

Enable supervisor to call multiple sub-agents simultaneously:

```python
# Current (sequential)
data1 = task("Query July", "query-agent")
data2 = task("Query October", "query-agent")

# Future (parallel)
results = parallel_tasks([
    ("Query July", "query-agent"),
    ("Query October", "query-agent")
])
```

### 2. More Specialized Sub-Agents

Add agents for specific domains:
- **Citation Agent**: Format sources and references
- **Visualization Agent**: Create charts/diagrams
- **Export Agent**: Format outputs for different mediums

### 3. Hierarchical Sub-Agents

Sub-agents can have their own sub-agents:
```
Supervisor
  └─ Query Agent
      ├─ Meeting Query Sub-Agent
      ├─ WhatsApp Query Sub-Agent
      └─ Document Query Sub-Agent
```

### 4. Persistent Sub-Agent Memory

Sub-agents could maintain their own memory across calls:
- Query Agent remembers recent queries
- Analysis Agent builds on previous analyses
