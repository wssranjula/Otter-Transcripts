# RAG Chatbot Implementation - Complete Summary

## What Was Built

A fully functional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that answers questions about meeting transcripts using:
- **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** (74 chunks, 221 entities, 42 decisions, 76 actions)
- **Mistral AI** (Large Language Model)
- **Python + LangChain** (Integration framework)

## How It Works

```
User Question
    ↓
1. SEARCH Neo4j Knowledge Base
   - Full-text search across conversation chunks
   - Find relevant entities (people, orgs, countries, topics)
   - Retrieve decisions and action items
    ↓
2. BUILD CONTEXT
   - Top 5 most relevant chunks
   - Meeting dates and speakers
   - Actual conversation text
    ↓
3. SEND TO MISTRAL AI
   - System prompt: "Answer from context only"
   - User prompt: Context + Question
    ↓
4. RETURN INTELLIGENT ANSWER
   - Structured response
   - Citations from meetings
   - Quotes from speakers
```

## Files Created

### Core Chatbot
- **`chatbot.py`** - Main chatbot with interactive and single-question modes
- **`test_chatbot.py`** - Automated testing script
- **`CHATBOT_README.md`** - Comprehensive user documentation
- **`CHATBOT_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Supporting Files (Already Existing)
- **`rag_queries.py`** - Neo4j query functions (fixed fulltext search bug)
- **`load_to_neo4j_rag.py`** - Database loader (fixed aggregate function bug)

## Usage Modes

### 1. Interactive Mode (Conversation)
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

**Example Session:**
```
You: What was discussed in the meetings?
Chatbot: Here's a concise summary... [detailed answer with citations]

You: Why was Germany deprioritized?
Chatbot: According to Tom Pravda in the meeting...

You: verbose
[Verbose mode: ON]

You: What action items were assigned?
[Searching knowledge base...]
[Retrieved 5 context chunks]
Chatbot: ...
```

### 2. Single Question Mode
```bash
python chatbot.py "Why was Germany deprioritized?"
```

### 3. Test Mode
```bash
python test_chatbot.py
```

## Current Statistics

From your knowledge base:

**Nodes:**
- 74 Chunks (conversation segments)
- 221 Entities (people, orgs, countries, topics)
- 2 Meetings
- 42 Decisions
- 76 Actions

**Relationships:**
- 370 MENTIONS (chunks → entities)

- Total: ~3-7 seconds per question
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.02 per question (Mistral Large)

## Bug Fixes Made

### 1. Neo4j Aggregate Function Error
**File:** `load_to_neo4j_rag.py` line 364-369
**Error:** `avg(count(c))` nested aggregates not allowed
**Fix:** Changed to:
```cypher
WITH m, count(c) as chunk_count
RETURN avg(chunk_count) as avg_chunks
```

### 2. Full-Text Search Parameter Conflict
**File:** `rag_queries.py` line 100-112
**Error:** `query` parameter conflicts with `session.run()` reserved name
**Fix:** Renamed parameter to `search_text`:
```python
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('chunk_text', $search_text)
```

## Configuration

### Neo4j Connection
```python
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://220210fe.databases.neo4j.io:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "uefo7_cCO4KdvrpS3knrhJ39Pwn2KDrFD0NCH4SKHv8"
```

### Mistral API
```python
MISTRAL_API_KEY = "xELPoQf6Msav4CZ7fPEAfcKnJTa4UOxn"
MODEL = "mistral-large-latest"
```

### RAG Parameters
```python
context_limit = 5  # Number of chunks to retrieve
temperature = 0.3  # Lower = more factual, higher = more creative
```

- Check credentials in chatbot.py
- Ensure knowledge base was loaded successfully

### "API errors"
- Verify Mistral API key is valid
- Check credits at https://console.mistral.ai/
- Try mistral-small-latest for lower cost

### "Slow responses"
- Normal: 3-7 seconds per question
- Neo4j query: ~1-2 seconds
- Mistral API: ~2-5 seconds
