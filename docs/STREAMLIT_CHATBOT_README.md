### Asking Questions

1. **Type your question** in the text area on the left
2. **Click "🚀 Ask"** button
3. **View the answer** generated by the AI
4. **Explore retrieved chunks** on the right to see what context was used

### Using Sample Questions

Click any of the sample questions in the sidebar to quickly test the system:
- "What were the key decisions in the last meeting?"
- "What actions were assigned to Tom?"
- "What is our Germany strategy?"
- etc.

### Adjusting Settings

**In the sidebar:**
- **Number of chunks to retrieve:**
  - Lower (3-5): Faster, more focused answers
  - Higher (10-15): More comprehensive, slower answers

- **Show retrieved chunks:** Toggle to show/hide the context used

### Understanding the Context Display

Each chunk card shows:
- **Header:** Meeting title and date
- **Metadata:**
  - Type: decision, action_assignment, assessment, discussion, question
  - Importance: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = more important)
  - Speakers: Number of unique speakers

- **Content:** The actual text from the meeting
- **Entities:** Key people, organizations, countries, topics mentioned

## 🎯 Example Workflow

### Example 1: Understanding a Decision

**Question:** "Why did we deprioritize Germany?"

**What happens:**
1. System retrieves 8 most relevant chunks about Germany
2. Shows you chunks containing:
   - Tom Pravda's assessment of Germany
   - Decision to deprioritize
   - Rationale about anti-SRM NGO risks
3. AI synthesizes answer from these chunks
4. You can read the original context to verify

### Example 2: Finding Action Items

**Question:** "What tasks are assigned to Ben Margetts?"

**What happens:**
1. System searches for action_assignment chunks
2. Filters for Ben Margetts as owner
3. Shows action items with meeting context
4. AI lists all tasks with deadlines and context

### Example 3: Temporal Queries

**Question:** "What was discussed in the June 11 meeting?"

**What happens:**
1. System detects date pattern "June 11"
2. Retrieves chunks specifically from 2025-06-11
3. Sorts by importance (decisions/actions first)
4. AI provides comprehensive meeting summary

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Update Database Credentials

Edit `streamlit_chatbot.py` lines 40-44:

```python
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://your-database.databases.neo4j.io:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "your-password"
MISTRAL_API_KEY = "your-mistral-api-key"
MODEL = "mistral-small-latest"  # or mistral-large-latest
```

### Adjust Default Settings

In the code (lines 97-102):

```python
context_limit = st.slider(
    "Number of chunks to retrieve",
    min_value=3,
    max_value=15,
    value=8,  # Change default here
    help="More chunks = more context but slower responses"
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- **Check:** Is streamlit installed? `pip install streamlit`
- **Check:** Are you in the correct directory?

### Connection errors
- **Check:** Neo4j database credentials in the code
- **Check:** Internet connection for Neo4j Aura
- **Check:** Mistral API key is valid

### No chunks displayed
- **Check:** "Show retrieved chunks" is enabled in sidebar
- **Check:** Database has data loaded
- **Try:** Asking a different question

### Slow responses
- **Reduce** number of chunks to retrieve (3-5 instead of 10-15)
- **Check:** Mistral API rate limits
- **Try:** Using `mistral-small-latest` instead of `mistral-large-latest`

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Be Specific**
- ❌ "Tell me about meetings"
- ✅ "What decisions were made about the High Ambition Coalition in June?"

### 2. **Use Entity Names**
- Mention specific people: "Tom Pravda", "Ben Margetts"
- Mention organizations: "Heinrich Böll Foundation"
- Mention countries: "Germany", "Kenya"

### 3. **Use Temporal Queries**
- "last meeting", "recent decisions", "latest update"
- Specific dates: "June 11", "May 28"

### 4. **Check the Context**
- Always review the retrieved chunks
- Verify the AI used relevant context
- If context seems off, rephrase your question

### 5. **Adjust Chunk Limit**
- Simple questions: 3-5 chunks
- Complex questions: 8-12 chunks
- Comprehensive summaries: 12-15 chunks
