UNEA prep call summary - 3 October 2025

Please find below a short summary of our UNEA prep call of 3 October. This is for internal use only, and does not constitute a verbatim record of the meeting.

Good first prep call ahead of the December UNEA meeting.

Broad consensus that the best outcome at UNEA-7 is no climate intervention/SRM resolution..

If no resolution is not possible, broad agreement to focus on language defending science and the dangers of near-term climate risks.

Agreement that Climate Hub would schedule follow-up call with scenario-based agenda and develop scenario discussion frameworks.

Agreement to consider organizing Green Room session, and to investigate the Science & Tech Major Group task force.

UNEA-7 calendar and green room time slots to be shared.

SUMMARY: UNEA-7 PREPARATORY COORDINATION CALL

Date: October 3, 2025
 Distribution: Meeting Participants + Relevant Organizations
 Classification: Internal Coordination - Not for Public Distribution

PURPOSE & PARTICIPANTS

Climate Hub convened representatives from 11+ organizations to coordinate strategy for UNEA-7 (December 2025) on solar radiation management (SRM) research.

Participating Organizations: Climate Hub, Degrees Initiative, Reflective, Carbon Gap (CFG), DSG, Center for Climate and Security, EDF, RFF, Silver Lining/UCLA Law, University of Chicago, plus former US State Department representatives.

KEY CONSENSUS: STRATEGIC NON-OUTCOME PREFERRED

Unanimous agreement: No formal SRM resolution at UNEA-7 is the best outcome.

Rationale:

International forums not currently positioned to be constructive for responsible research agenda

High risk of harmful language impeding legitimate scientific research

Insufficient government capacity and understanding

Risk of premature/extreme conclusions before adequate learning

Secondary priorities if non-outcome fails:

Defense of science and evidence-based approaches

Near-term climate risk assessment (without explicit SRM mention)

Joint UNEP-WMO monitoring/repository (though previously opposed by UNEP)

CRITICAL STATE OF PLAY

Resolution Status

No formal resolutions tabled as of deadline

Switzerland: NOT submitting (unlike previous two UNEA sessions)

Africa Group: No proposal yet; mixed enthusiasm despite AMCEN decisions

Risk: Member states can introduce resolutions late or from the floor

Alternative Pathways for Language

Ministerial Declaration (Oman presidency): Could include SRM paragraphs

Major Groups & Stakeholders (MGS): Opposition effectively mobilized; two-day meetings ahead of UNEA

Green Room Sessions (Dec 5-12): Capacity building opportunities; member state engagement possible

Critical Dynamics

UNEP vs. WMO:

UNEP perceived as biased against SRM research; relationship with WMO "very strained"

WMO may not attend UNEA-7

Previous US push for joint repository rejected by UNEP

US Participation:

Under executive order review; UNEA potentially "on the chopping block"

Attendance unclear

Previous role: critical vocal opposition to problematic proposals

AMCEN Context:

SRM language appeared in final decisions despite initial non-progression

Decisions made "behind closed doors"

Opposition literature pre-placed at venues

AMCEN meeting scheduled during UNEA-7 margins

KEY RISKS & CONCERNS

1. Messaging Control

Even with non-outcome, risk of public misrepresentation (e.g., previous US repository support portrayed as "deployment agenda")

Opposition Tactics:

Pre-positioned literature

Coordinated MGS positions (except youth group)

Ready-to-deploy press releases (CIEL)

False Global North vs. South framing

2. Capacity Imbalances

Opposition strategically positioned in MGS processes (Science & Tech Major Group task force likely)

Government understanding gaps on state of science, governance implications, geopolitical complexity

Education needed but must not provoke resolution introduction

3. Coordination Challenges

Must avoid "Global North agenda" perception

Requires joint Global South hosting/participation

Various organizational mandates and constraints

ACTION ITEMS

Immediate Actions (Assigned)

Farhan (Climate Hub):

Schedule next call with scenario-based agenda

Coordinate summary distribution with Geraldine

Develop scenario discussion frameworks

Anita (Degrees):

Share UNEA-7 calendar and green room time slots

Monitor Science & Tech Major Group task force

Consider organizing green room session (last day of OECPR suggested)

Sue:

Monitor Switzerland/Africa Group positions

Track US participation decision

Update on UNEP-WMO relationship

All with side event applications: Confirm response by Oct 30

Group Actions (No Specific Ownership)

Pre-UNEA (Now - November):

Develop coordinated response strategies for 4 scenarios: (1) last-minute non-use resolution, (2) ministerial declaration with SRM, (3) strong MGS calls to action, (4) benign-seeming problematic proposals

Identify capacity building opportunities (politically neutral, geographically diverse)

Pre-develop messaging frameworks for counter-narratives

Map potential vocal governments if US absent; assess youth major group engagement potential

During UNEA-7 (Dec 5-12):

Execute green room/side events (joint Global South-North hosting, capacity-focused)

Strategic MGS participation to inject accurate science, counter opposition unanimity

Monitor: late resolutions, ministerial declaration drafts, MGS influence, member state positions

Post-UNEA (January+):

Narrative management regardless of outcome

Move beyond "sprint" to sustained legitimacy-building

Advance monitoring capabilities, pooled funding exploration (Gavi model), UNEP-WMO tension resolution

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

✓ Avoid provocation - Don't trigger resolution introduction
 ✓ Diverse representation essential - Include Global South partners as hosts/organizers
 ✓ Evidence focus - Frame around science, not politics
 ✓ Process over outcomes - Ensure informed discussion and proper procedures
 ✓ Prepare for persistence - Opposition well-funded; expect annual challenges

NEXT STEPS TIMELINE

Next 2 Weeks: Confirm participation, schedule next call, share UNEA calendar, map partners
 Through November: Finalize scenarios, develop educational content, establish communication protocols
 December 5-12: Execute strategy at UNEA-7
 January+: Assess outcomes, transition to sustained coordination

CONFIDENTIALITY

Internal coordination only. Not for public distribution. Meeting characterized as "informal behind the scenes discussion amongst friends and colleagues from the broader field."
