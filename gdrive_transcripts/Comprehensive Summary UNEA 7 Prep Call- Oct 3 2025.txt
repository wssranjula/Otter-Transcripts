Comprehensive Summary – UNEA-7 Preparatory Coordination Call

Date: October 3, 2025
Duration: ~1 hour
Convened by: Climate Hub
Facilitators: Tom (Climate Hub) & Farhan (Climate Hub)
Participants: Representatives from Climate Hub, Degrees, Reflective, CFG, DSG, CCS, EDF, RFF, UCLA, and others — including Sue, Anita, Matthias, Hugo, Michael, Natasha, Andrew, Nicolas, Zander, and Geraldine.

1. Meeting Objective

To coordinate among like-minded organizations on Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and climate intervention governance ahead of UNEA-7 (December 2025).
 The call aimed to:

Align expectations on desired and undesired UNEA-7 outcomes.

Exchange intelligence on the state of play and emerging dynamics.

Identify risks, messaging strategies, and engagement points.

Outline next steps for collective preparedness and coordination.

2. Strategic Context

UNEA-7 Risk Landscape

UNEA-7 could feature last-minute proposals on SRM or broader “climate intervention” governance.

Such resolutions risk being politically charged and scientifically premature, potentially constraining responsible research.

Opposition groups have mobilized effectively within civil society and multilateral processes, shaping the narrative toward moratoria or “non-use agreements.”

UNEP’s current posture is perceived as biased against SRM research, creating friction with WMO, which takes a more neutral scientific approach.

Current Status

No SRM resolution tabled as of the call.

Switzerland will not re-introduce its earlier SRM resolution text.

African Group divided: some members cautious despite AMCEN’s call for stronger language.

U.S. participation uncertain due to internal executive review of UNEA membership.

UNEA-7 will include side events and Green Room sessions (Dec 5–12). These are seen as key opportunities for constructive, factual engagement.

3. Core Consensus Points

Shared Goal:
 Maintain space for responsible, science-driven SRM research while avoiding restrictive, polarizing, or misinformed decisions at UNEA-7.

Preferred Outcome:
 A “non-outcome” (no resolution or formal text) — widely agreed as the best possible result.

Guiding Principles:

Do no harm — prevent actions that could damage research legitimacy or public understanding.

Stay coordinated — anticipate political and communications risks.

Use UNEA for education — not negotiation.

Amplify Global South voices — avoid perception of a Global North–dominated agenda.

Engage discreetly — behind-the-scenes collaboration rather than public advocacy.

5. Procedural Insights from Discussion

Late resolutions are common: SRM text could still appear during the last 24–48 hours.

AMCEN language calling for a “non-use” agreement might resurface via African Group channels.

UNEP–WMO conflict: undermines trust in technical assessments; coordination between them should be encouraged.

MGS engagement: opposition groups dominate most major group consultations, except the Children & Youth group, which remains open to balanced dialogue.

Green Room sessions: intended for MGS capacity-building; provide a discreet educational platform.

Timeline: Green Rooms run Dec 5–12; Side Events run Dec 8–12. Proposal submissions close Oct 30.

7. Broader Strategic Considerations

Educational leverage: UNEA-7 should be treated as a platform to normalize responsible research, not to defend it reactively.

Narrative management: Key risk is the external perception of polarization (North vs South). Communications must highlight diverse, globally representative support for scientific inquiry.

Procedural literacy: Many delegates encounter SRM issues for the first time at UNEA; pre-briefing sessions and factual materials could prevent misinformation from dominating.

Sustained coalition: Participants noted the need for a standing coordination mechanism beyond UNEA-7, anticipating continued anti-research activism in multilateral fora.

8. Tone and Interpersonal Dynamics

Collaborative and candid; sense of shared purpose.

Humor and familiarity indicated longstanding working relationships.

High mutual respect; no significant disagreements beyond nuances of engagement timing and framing.

Clear recognition that coordination must remain confidential (“behind the scenes, not secretive”).

9. Immediate Deliverables (Next 2 Weeks)

Circulate finalized contact list and Slack channel details (Geraldine).

Distribute calendar of UNEA/Green Room events and open time slots (Anita).

Draft one-page strategic memo summarizing non-outcome position for discreet sharing with supportive governments (Farhan).

Confirm which organizations will co-host or support a Green Room session (Degrees / Reflective).

Collect intelligence updates from partners on African Group and UNEP-WMO developments (Sue, Anita).

10. Closing & Next Steps

Climate Hub to convene a second coordination call (late October) to finalize tactical planning: event proposals, scenario responses, and unified messaging.

Participants to confirm organizational commitment to continued coordination.

Climate Hub to manage logistical support and provide funding where needed.

The group concluded with consensus that UNEA-7 poses both risk and opportunity: risk of politicized restriction, opportunity for scientific clarity.
 All participants affirmed a commitment to strategic coordination, factual communication, and long-term collaboration to advance responsible SRM research governance.

4. Organizational Positions (Summary) | 4. Organizational Positions (Summary) | 4. Organizational Positions (Summary)
Organization | Position / Focus | Notes & Key Inputs
Climate Hub | Coordinating neutral convener; focus on tactical readiness and information sharing. | Will facilitate next steps, funding, and accreditation if needed.
Degrees (Jesse, Anita) | Neutral; supports Global South capacity to engage on SRM; no advocacy for or against. | Emphasized the narrative that Global South is monolithic or anti-research.
Reflective (Hugo) | Research-focused; supports establishing long-term legitimacy and possible pooled funding for SRM research (Gavi model). | Open to exploring global coordination models.
CFG (Matthias) | Supports learning, shared terminology, and EU self-declared moratorium on large-scale SRM experiments. | Warned that SRM debates can trigger premature conclusions.
DSG (Michael) | “Do no harm”; avoid damaging perception of research; ensure clear messaging if blocking resolutions. | Suggested proactive explanation if procedural block occurs.
CCS (Erin) | Prioritizes informed debate and process integrity. | Supports education of policymakers through careful engagement.
EDF (Natasha) | Focused on “no harm” and education; non-outcome preferred. | Views UNEA as an opportunity for dialogue, not decisions.
RFF | Observational; focused on governance and social science aspects. | No advocacy role.
UCLA / SilverLining (Nicolas) | Non-outcome ideal; stressed transparent communications. | Warned against political framing of procedural actions.
University of Chicago (Andrew) | Agreed that “no outcome” best; wary of anti-research exploitation. | Suggested possible coalition of supportive countries.
Independent experts (Sue, Anita, Zander) | Provided procedural intelligence, UNEP-WMO insight, and historical background on 2019–2024 UNEA SRM debates. | Confirmed UNEP bias and African Ministerial
6. Agreed Follow-Up Actions
