# Fix Google Drive Token Issue

## Problem
```
google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError: Token has been expired or revoked
```

The Google Drive authentication token in `config/token.pickle` has expired and needs to be refreshed.

---

## Quick Fix (Option 1: Delete and Re-authenticate)

### Step 1: Delete the expired token
```bash
# Windows
del config\token.pickle

# Linux/Mac
rm config/token.pickle
```

### Step 2: Re-run setup
```bash
# This will trigger the OAuth flow
python run_gdrive.py setup
```

A browser window will open asking you to:
1. Choose your Google account
2. Grant access to Google Drive
3. A new `token.pickle` will be created automatically

### Step 3: Restart the unified agent
```bash
python run_unified_agent.py
```

---

## Alternative Fix (Option 2: Run Standalone GDrive First)

If you want to test Google Drive separately:

```bash
# Setup Google Drive authentication
python run_gdrive.py setup

# Test with batch processing
python run_gdrive.py batch

# Once it works, restart unified agent
python run_unified_agent.py
```

---

## Temporary Workaround (Option 3: Disable GDrive)

If you want to use only WhatsApp for now:

Edit `config/config.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "gdrive_monitor": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart:
```bash
python run_unified_agent.py
```

Only WhatsApp will run (no Google Drive errors).

## Current Status

‚úÖ **WhatsApp Bot** - Working perfectly!
- Listening on: `http://localhost:8000/whatsapp/webhook`
- Ready to receive messages
- Connected to Neo4j and Mistral

‚ùå **Google Drive Monitor** - Token expired
- Needs re-authentication
- Follow steps above to fix

---

## Test WhatsApp (Works Now!)

### 1. Setup ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

### 2. Configure Twilio Webhook
In Twilio Console, set webhook URL to:
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/whatsapp/webhook
```

### 3. Send Test Message
Send to your WhatsApp:
```
@agent What was discussed in the last meeting?
```

You should get a response! üéâ

---

## Check Server Status

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should show WhatsApp healthy, GDrive unhealthy (until token fixed)
```

---

## Summary

Your unified agent **IS WORKING**! 

- ‚úÖ Server is running on port 8000
- ‚úÖ WhatsApp bot is ready and functional
- ‚ùå Google Drive needs token refresh (easy fix above)

**The graceful error handling is working perfectly** - the Google Drive issue didn't crash the server, and WhatsApp is still fully operational! This is exactly what we designed it to do.
